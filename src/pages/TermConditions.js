                                    <li>  You make a request when the initial concepts for a logo are offered. However once you approve or request changes in the initial designs, the refund offer becomes void and refund request will not be entertained.</li>

                                    <li>If request for refund is made within 48 hours, you would be eligible for 66% refund (less 10% service &amp; processing fee).</li>
                                    <li> If request for refund is made between 48- 120 hours of the initial design delivery, you would be eligible 33% refund (less 10% service &amp; processing fee).</li>

                                    <li>  No refund requests will be entertained after the final files have been delivered. </li>
                                    <li>For website packages no refund will be entertained once website development has been started  or once the website has been deployed live.</li>
                                    <li>For video animation packages no refund request will be entertained after the designing of the storyboard.</li>
                                    <li>  All refund requests should be communicated to the support department. National Logo Designs, based on the violation of your user agreement reserves the right to approve/disapprove your request on an individual case to case basis. </li>

                                    <li>  For example, if you order logo and web design service and approve the logo, you can claim refund for the website service at the time of initial design only.(Refund will be prorated based on the bundle discount). </li>
                                    <li>  A refund request will need to have a valid reason which must be qualified against the design brief and customer feedback for revisions. Unless a concept has not been designed according to the brief, a refund will not be given however further revisions will be provided until complete satisfaction</li>
                                    <li>  Money back guarantee is based on that the order is placed in good faith. Where a customer has placed design orders with more than one design agency for the same job with the intention to claim refund, we do not consider it a good faith. In such a case we reserve the right to decline a refund request. </li>
                                    <li>  All design jobs require customer feedback before finalizing the design therefore it is only fair that the customer gets involved and provides feedback in order to get the desired results. </li>
